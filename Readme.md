This project is a Go REST API example that uses OpenAPI (Swagger) to define endpoints and oapi-codegen to generate type-safe server code.
It demonstrates complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing users, with automatic validation and documentation support.

Key features:

✅ API contract-first design using OpenAPI spec (openapi.yaml).

✅ Generated Go types and handlers with oapi-codegen.

✅ RESTful endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

✅ CORS enabled for Swagger Editor / UI testing.

✅ Uses Chi router for routing.

✅ Easy integration with Swagger UI.
